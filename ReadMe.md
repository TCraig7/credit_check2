# Questions

1. What are you proud of? I'm proud of the fact that I was able to get the algorithm figured out on the first night the project was assigned, and so I was able to go more in depth into making the runner methods and refactoring. I learned a lot on this project which was really cool.
1. What do you need to improve? My runner methods and naming. I sometimes wasn't clear with my variable names which ended up confusing me and making my runner methods confusing.
1. What questions do you still have? Nothing right now.

# Rubric

## Functionality - 4

Notes: I need to work on naming variable more clearly.

- [X] Student completes through Iteration 3

## Mechanics - 4

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] appropriately uses Strings, Integers, Floats, Ranges, Symbols, Nils, Arrays, and Hashes
- [X] implements best-choice enumerable methods to iterate over collections
- [X] uses boolean expressions and flow control structures to logically manage a program's flow
- [X] uses methods, arguments, and return values to break code into logical components
- [X] creates Classes that utilize instance variables, attribute accessors, and instance methods

## Design - 4

Notes:

The student(s):

- [X] adheres to the Single Responsibility and DRY principles
- [X] creates Objects and Classes that appropriately encompass state and behavior
- [X] uses instance and local variables appropriately
- [X] writes readable code with the following characteristics:
    * Variable and method names are self explanatory
    * Methods are under 7 lines
    * Lines of code are under 80 characters
    * Project directory structure adheres to convention
    * A linter reports less than 5 errors

## Testing - 4

Notes: Wrote test file before starting the code

The student(s):

- [X] writes Minitest tests that describe the expected behavior of a program according to technical specifications
- [X] names and orders tests so that a test file reads like documentation
- [X] writes Minitest assertions that accurately test a piece of functionality
- [X] writes a test before writing code that implements the behavior to make that test pass
- [X] writes both integration and unit tests

## Version Control - 2

Notes: Only made one branch and broke git when I did :(

The student(s):

- [X] hosts their code on the master branch of their remote repository
- [X] makes commits in small chunks of functionality
- [X] submits and merges Pull Requests using the Github interface
